# TODO List

These are not issues or bugs, just a roadmap for my development.

## Major
- [ ] Create object with Object Toolkit.
- [ ] Work on JSON format to allow Splunk to more readily pick out obvious fields like value and tagname.

## Minor
- [ ] Create example showing how to use an array of adresses and indirects for multiple tags of data with a single object
- [ ] Benchmark indexing storage metrics for different types of tags to allow proper estimation of licensing cost for a given size system.

## Testing
- [ ] Test with Splunk Universal Forwarders


## Other
- [ ] Learn how to use markdown and try to figure out why everyone loves it so much.  HTML with a sprinkle of CSS seemed pretty good for my tastes.  It isn't like we are working over 28.8K modems here.
